# Wine Quality Prediction App (Heroku Deployment)

# Part 1 â€“ Wine Quality Prediction App (Heroku Deployment)

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the quality of red wine using a **Linear Regression** model trained on the UCI Wine Quality dataset. The app provides an HTML interface where users can input wine attributes and receive a predicted quality score.
